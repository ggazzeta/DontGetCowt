## 🚀 About the Game  
**Don't Get Cowt!** is a fun 2D pixel-art game where you control a UFO on a mission to abduct cows while avoiding detection!  
This game was created upon an idea that my girlfriend had.

"Why not make a game about abducting cows in a farm?"

This idea later became a theme for a work at my college and led us to this demo.

- **Pixel-Art Style** – A charming retro aesthetic that enhances the experience.  
- **Play Anywhere** – Designed for web browsers, playable on both PC and mobile devices.
